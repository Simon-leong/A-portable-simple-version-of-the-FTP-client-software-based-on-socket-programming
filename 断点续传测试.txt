In this article, we proposed a three-phase facial expression recognizer to handle the label noisy
and incomplete problem for FER task. Different from the previous studies, our approach adopts
three continuous phases for model training, sample selection, and sample relabeling, respectively,
with the hope that the noisy and incomplete information of labels could be corrected and supplemented for performance improvement. Technically, we design several simple and reasonable
rules to select samples and reduce noise, as well as a composite two-label loss function to ensure
the correct feature extraction and category prediction. The architecture is quite simple with few
cost, and could be easily embedded into the existing FER approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments on RAF-DB, FER2013, and AffectNet datasets. The experimental results demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and is robust to noisy
samples for FER task.  // 测试前准备
